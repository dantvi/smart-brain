# Smart Brain Frontend - Face Detection App

Smart Brain is a web-based face detection application that uses AI to identify faces in user-uploaded images. This project is part of the Complete Web Developer Course by Zero To Mastery and demonstrates full-stack development skills, including React for the front-end and Node.js with PostgreSQL for the back-end.

## Overview

The Smart Brain App allows users to:
- Face Detection: Upload an image, and the application will detect faces using an AI model.
- User Authentication: Register or sign in to track your face detection activity.
- Interactive Design: Intuitive UI with animations and responsive elements.

### Built with

#### Frontend
- React: For building the user interface.
- Tachyons: For styling the application.
- Particles-bg: For adding dynamic background particles.
#### Backend
- Node.js & Express: For handling server-side logic and routing.
- PostgreSQL: For user and activity data storage.
- Clarifai API: For face detection functionality.
#### Other Tools
- Heroku: Deployment platform for both the front-end and back-end.
- RESTful APIs: For communication between the client and server.

### How It Works

- User Authentication:
  - Users can register with their name, email, and password.
  - Returning users can log in with their credentials.
- Face Detection:
  - Users enter the URL of an image.
  - The app sends the URL to the back-end, which then uses the Clarifai API to analyze the image.
  - Detected faces are highlighted on the image.
- Leaderboard:
  - The app tracks the number of detections for each user and displays their progress on the dashboard.

### What I learned

This project allowed me to:
- Build a complete full-stack application using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
- Work with third-party APIs (Clarifai) to integrate AI functionality.
- Enhance user authentication with server-side validation.
- Use React components and props to create a modular, reusable codebase.

Hereâ€™s an example of the component handling face detection and image display:

```jsx
import './face-recognition.styles.css';

const FaceRecognition = ({ imageUrl, box }) => {
  return (
    <div className="center ma">
      <div className="absolute mt2">
        <img id="inputimage" alt="" src={imageUrl} width="500px" height="auto" />
        <div
          className="bounding-box"
          style={{
            top: box.topRow,
            right: box.rightCol,
            bottom: box.bottomRow,
            left: box.leftCol,
          }}
        ></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default FaceRecognition;
```

This component:
- Displays the submitted image.
- Highlights the detected face using the bounding box coordinates passed as props.

### Continued development

In future iterations, I plan to:
- Add image upload functionality directly from the user's device.
- Improve the UI/UX with additional animations and themes.
- Implement multi-face detection and detailed analysis.
- Optimize for mobile performance. 

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dantvi/smart-brain.git
cd smart-brain
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server: 
```bash
npm start
```

Note: Ensure the backend is set up and running for the face detection functionality to work.
